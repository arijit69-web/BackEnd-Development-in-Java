<!--The index.html page is automatically loaded if no page or path is given.-->
<meta http-equiv="refresh"
      content="0; URL='employees/list'">

<!-- HTML meta refresh tag. It's used to automatically redirect a web page to a different URL after a specified amount of time.-->

<!--    <meta>: This is an HTML element used to provide metadata about the document or to specify HTTP headers in the <head> section of an HTML document.-->
<!--    http-equiv="refresh": This attribute specifies an HTTP header for the document. In this case, it's set to "refresh," indicating that the page should be refreshed or redirected.-->
<!--    content="0; URL='employees/list'": This is where the action is defined. It consists of two parts:-->
<!--        0: This specifies the number of seconds before the refresh or redirection should occur. In this case, it's set to 0, meaning the redirection will happen immediately when the page is loaded.-->
<!--        URL='employees/list': This specifies the URL to which the page should be redirected. In this example, it's set to "employees/list."-->
<!--    So, when a user opens a page containing this meta refresh tag, the page will immediately redirect them to the "employees/list" URL. It's a way to automatically send visitors to another page without requiring any user interaction. However, this approach is not typically recommended for modern web development because it can disrupt the user experience and may not be as accessible or SEO-friendly as other methods like using server-side redirects or JavaScript-based redirection.-->
